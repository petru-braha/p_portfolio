Basic stuff:
- each project includes a README file with a complex description. here is just a summary (in cronological order) of all my experience so far.
- to test a project, it's recommended to download its folder

the list of my c++ projects: 
1. BetterWinrar
   = compress or decompress data and includes:
      - file explorer (done using graphics.h)
      - Huffman trees
      - Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm
   - build: gcc 17, 32 bit compiler, codeblocks

2. implementation of the studied data structures
   - BT (binary tree, complete binary tree)
   - T (general tree, disjoint set collection)

next to be done:
    - MH (maxheap)
    - BST (binary search tree)
    - G (graph, diagraph)
    - DT (digital tree, tries)
    - Hash tables

3. Particles (early stages)
