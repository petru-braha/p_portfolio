each data structure folder will include the project itself and a "README" documentation file. usage/goal: to display correctly the structure for any operation/function called.

personal objective:

to apply the theory learned
to understand concepts and manipulate them freely
to properly use code (my classes didn't train this ability)
to have a file foundation if my future projects will ever need the implementations here
to build more complex functions (specific problems that concern the shaping of the structure) and to be able to display the result in an intuitive way.
extra details about the display function:

binary tree, complete binary tree
disjoint set collection, tree
